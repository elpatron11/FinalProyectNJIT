 ANSR is an open source platform  for learning that welcomes anybody that needs a question answered and anybody willing to answer questions. It focuses on user-to-user interactions to connect people over the joy of sharing and acquiring knowledge regarding any topic that one can think of. 
It gives users editorial power through a rating system that applies to posts in order to filter and focus more on the relevant and useful answers.
